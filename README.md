# Library-Management-System
Designed a library management system Using PHP and MySql

The Library Mangement System was developed as an academic project demonstrating the application of the concepts of Web Development and Database Management Systems.

The system was designed and tested on PHP 7.2.4 and phpMyAdmin version 4.8.0.
The project uses bootstrap to implement styling in the pages.

The project also contains a sample database file to initialise with a few standard entires and understand the dB schema.(Check: sampledb/library.sql)
The admin portal is separate and can be accessed by viewing the '/admin/' link. There is no direct from the Guest user login page to the administration page.

Further Steps Required:
1. Extensive testing of the system is not done. The system may contain some bugs that needs to be fixed.
2. Standard vulnerabilities have to be fixed for actual deployment.
